# 🎯 Intelligent shadcn Component System

## Overview

The `//shad next` command is an intelligent automation system that analyzes your current component inventory, compares it against the complete shadcn/ui library, and automatically selects and builds the most effective component to implement next.

## How It Works

### 1. 📦 Component Inventory Analysis

- Scans `src/components/ui/` for existing Daedalus components
- Identifies all implemented components with proper folder structure
- Creates comprehensive inventory of current capabilities

### 2. 🧮 Effectiveness Scoring Algorithm

Each missing shadcn component is scored on a 100-point scale:

**Usage Frequency (40 points)**

- High usage: 40 points (Button, Input, Label, etc.)
- Medium usage: 25 points (Calendar, Combobox, etc.)
- Low usage: 10 points (Resizable, Menubar, etc.)

**Complexity Weight (30 points)**

- Low complexity: 30 points (Label, Separator, Tooltip)
- Medium complexity: 20 points (Modal, Tabs, Popover)
- High complexity: 10 points (Command, Chart, Calendar)

**Dependency Satisfaction (20 points)**

- No dependencies: 20 points
- All dependencies available: 20 points
- Partial dependencies: Proportional score
- Missing dependencies: Lower score

**Foundation Component Bonus (10 points)**

- Components that other components depend on get bonus points
- Examples: Label, Separator, Tooltip, Switch, Skeleton

### 3. 🚀 Intelligent Selection

The algorithm prioritizes components that:

- ✅ Have high usage in real applications
- ✅ Are easy to implement (low complexity)
- ✅ Have their dependencies already built
- ✅ Enable building other components (foundation components)

### 4. 🏗️ Enterprise Component Creation

Once selected, the system executes the full `//comp` workflow:

- Creates folder-per-component structure
- Generates CVA variants and TypeScript interfaces
- Creates 25+ comprehensive tests
- Builds interactive Storybook stories
- Ensures WCAG accessibility compliance
- Updates component registry and documentation
- Integrates into component showcase

## Usage

### Command Line

```bash
# Analyze and show recommendation
yarn shad:analyze

# Execute intelligent component creation
yarn shad:next

# Or use shorthand processor
yarn shorthand "//shad next"
```

### In Chat (Shorthand)

```
//shad next
```

## Current Component Inventory

### ✅ Implemented (18 components)

- Accordion, Alert, Avatar, Badge, Button
- Card, Checkbox, DataTable, Dialog, Input
- Modal, Progress, Select, Slider, Tabs
- Textarea, ThemeToggle, Toast

### 🎯 Available for Implementation (27 components)

**Foundation Components (Perfect Scores)**

- Label (100/100) - Accessible form labels
- Switch (100/100) - Toggle switch input
- Separator (100/100) - Visual content dividers
- Skeleton (100/100) - Loading state placeholders
- Tooltip (100/100) - Hover and focus tooltips

**High Priority Components**

- Form (85/100) - Form validation and state management
- Popover (80/100) - Floating content overlay
- ScrollArea (80/100) - Custom scrollbar styling
- AlertDialog (75/100) - Confirmation dialogs
- Sheet (75/100) - Slide-out panels

**Advanced Components**

- Command (60/100) - Command palette with search
- Calendar (55/100) - Date picker with navigation
- DatePicker (50/100) - Date selection with popup
- Chart (40/100) - Data visualization charts

## Intelligence Features

### 🧠 Smart Dependency Management

The system understands component relationships:

- Won't recommend DatePicker until Calendar is built
- Prioritizes Label before Form components
- Considers Popover dependencies for HoverCard

### 📊 Usage-Based Prioritization

Based on real-world component usage patterns:

- Form components get highest priority
- Navigation elements are medium priority
- Specialized components are lower priority

### 🏗️ Foundation-First Strategy

Builds foundational components that enable others:

- Label enables Form, Input enhancements
- Separator enables layout components
- Tooltip enables enhanced UX across all components

### 🎯 Complexity-Aware Scheduling

Balances impact vs. implementation effort:

- Prioritizes high-impact, low-effort components
- Defers complex components until dependencies are ready
- Optimizes for rapid capability expansion

## Benefits

1. **10x Speed**: Eliminates decision paralysis - system chooses optimal next step
2. **Strategic Building**: Foundation-first approach enables rapid capability expansion
3. **Quality Consistency**: Every component built with same enterprise standards
4. **Dependency Optimization**: Smart ordering prevents implementation blockers
5. **Zero Mental Overhead**: Fully automated component selection and creation
