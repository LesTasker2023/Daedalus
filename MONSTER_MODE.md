## 🎯 Monster Test Categories

### 🔥 **CRITICAL - Must Pass for Scaling**

- ✅ **Zero backup files** - No `.backup`, `.bak`, `.old` files allowed
- ✅ **Zero any types** - Production code must be type-safe
- ✅ **Zero console statements** - No debug logging in production

### 🏗️ **TECH DEBT - Monitored & Tracked**

- 📊 **TODO/FIXME comments** - Dynamic limit: 50 + (components × 2)
- 📊 **Script count** - Dynamic limit: 40 + (components × 1.5)

### 🚀 **PRODUCTION READINESS**

- ✅ **Consistent naming** - All components must be PascalCase
- ✅ **Complete architecture** - All components need required files
- 📊 **Test coverage** - Minimum 60% (scales down for larger codebases)

### 📈 **SCALING READINESS**

- 📦 **Dependency optimization** - Monitors bloat
- 🎯 **Architecture consistency** - Folder-per-component pattern
- 🚀 **Deployment checklist** - All config files present

## 🤖 Adaptive Intelligence

**Monster Mode automatically adapts to your codebase:**

- **Component Count**: Currently tracking **49 components**
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Limits scale with your growth
- **Smart Exclusions**: Preserves necessary logging in API routes, tests, demos
- **Progressive Standards**: Higher standards for smaller codebases

## 🛠️ Automation Scripts

**All scripts are in `/scripts/` and called via package.json:**

### Cleanup Scripts (Node.js ESM)

- `cleanup-backups.mjs` - Multi-pattern backup file removal
- `cleanup-console.mjs` - Intelligent console statement removal
- `cleanup-todos.mjs` - TODO/FIXME analysis and categorization

### Fix Scripts (Node.js ESM)

- `fix-any-types.mjs` - Safe any-type replacement
- `fix-missing-files.mjs` - Component file generation with templates
- `fix-naming.mjs` - Automated PascalCase conversion with import updates

### Legacy Scripts (PowerShell)

- Various PowerShell scripts for specialized operations

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Pre-Commit Workflow

```bash
# Before committing changes
yarn audit:monster        # Check current status
yarn harden               # Fix critical issues
yarn audit:monster        # Verify fixes
```

### Pre-Deployment Workflow

```bash
# Before scaling/deploying
yarn monster-mode         # Complete hardening
yarn pre-scale           # Final validation + build
# ✅ Ready to scale!
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# During development
yarn audit:watch          # Keep tests running
yarn fix:missing-files    # Generate files for new components
yarn audit:monster        # Periodic full check
```

## 🔧 Configuration

**Monster Mode is zero-config but adaptive:**

- **Automatically discovers** your component structure
- **Scales thresholds** based on codebase size
- **Preserves necessary** console logging in appropriate files
- **Generates missing** files with proper templates

## 📈 Success Metrics

**Track your codebase health:**

- **Critical Issues**: Must be 0 for scaling
- **Tech Debt**: Monitored and tracked over time
- **Test Coverage**: Adaptive targets based on size
- **Architecture**: Consistency across all components

## 🚀 Scaling Ready Checklist

- [ ] All critical tests passing
- [ ] Tech debt under dynamic thresholds
- [ ] Test coverage above minimum
- [ ] All components follow naming conventions
- [ ] Complete file architecture
- [ ] Build passes successfully

**When all checks pass: YOUR CODEBASE IS MONSTER-READY! 🔥**
